Hello World! Welcome to my website. Let me introduce myself. I am — a web technologist, architect, and lifelong builder. I craft scalable, high-impact web systems with a focus on clean design, performance, and real-world value.

Over the years, I’ve led the architecture for platforms in finance, travel, and e-commerce logistics — each shaping my approach to building resilient, elegant systems. From Redis-backed messaging flows to custom MongoDB abstractions, I enjoy solving complex problems with thoughtful code.

I’m passionate about writing libraries, contributing to the open-source community, and creating tools that make developers more productive. I believe great products are built by great teams — and I thrive on collaboration and continuous learning.

Still seeking bold, challenging problems — and always eager to build what’s next.
