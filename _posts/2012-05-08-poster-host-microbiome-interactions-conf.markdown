My abstract was selected for the [Host-Microbiome Interactions in Health and Disease](https://registration.hinxton.wellcome.ac.uk/display_info.asp?id=271) conference at the Sanger Institute, which is great news. Already a few hours of the meeting went by and I don't think I ever talked so much microbiome in so little time. Here is a [low resolution pdf of my poster]({{ site.url }}/downloads/documents/ibdML-poster.pdf).

I would probably design it differently, now that I have had the chance to see it on the wall. Too much text and the font was too tiny.
